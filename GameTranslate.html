WOLF 1
First time I saw him, he was tearing into his packmate’s belly. His massive jaw clamping around flesh, his fangs ripping out the insides. No mercy. No remorse. The other wolf let out a long, piercing cry, then went completely still. I don’t know what its crime was, and at that moment, I felt sorry for it. But even more so, I couldn’t take my eyes away from its killer. He was magnificent, twice as big as any other wolf I’ve ever seen, with a thick, shiny pelt. He glanced around the cave as if making sure his pack got the message, then yawned and curled up, ready to sleep. Everyone else soon followed.

This was my only chance. I came here hoping to dig out some meat, but the wolves got back too soon. Caught me off guard. I knew I didn’t have much time. Wolves don’t really sleep as much as they power nap. Honestly, I didn’t think I was going to make it. Not after seeing what their leader did.</>

WOLF 2
I saw him again. I was lying in bed, and when I opened my eyes, there he was. His claws digging into my chest, his teeth bared in a soundless snarl. I could only stare at him, my body frozen in horror. And then, his massive jaws opened, and darkness swallowed me. I woke up to the sound of my own screams.

I thought that was the end of it. But ever since then, something’s… changed. I see things in the forest. Shapes from the corner of my eye. But they’re gone as soon as I look their way. Am I just tired?

I think one of them looked like a wolf…</>
<div>1421_BookHuntingSkinning_Content=Dec 3, 1981
DEER TRAP
As I was building the trap, my mind went back to the Wolf. The way he massacred his packmate, then went right back to sleep. I started wondering what it would feel like to be such a creature. To rush through the land, driven by hunger and instinct, but still smart enough to herd your prey into ravines. Deep snowbanks. Slow it down. Take turns to tire it out. Let the young ones watch and learn. And then, finally. Sink your teeth into it. Gorge on 20 pounds of meat.

The trap was ready. All I had to do was find deer tracks and set it somewhere along the trail. Then wait till I heard the sound. The sound of something struggling to survive, but in a way, already dead. The trap was efficient. But it felt… clumsy. Compared to the way wolves hunt, it felt like cheating.

Surviving in the wild - how to skin a deer
Practice makes perfect. Start with the legs. You should cut around all four of them, then along the interior. That will loosen the skin. Next, pull the hide off the hind legs. Slice through the connective tissue to separate the skin from thigh muscles and bones. After that, it’s easy. Just grab the hide and peel it down, away from the torso. Stop at the shoulders. You’ll need to slice through the connective tissue again, then through the front legs, the same way you did with the rear ones. Then, skin the neck and chop the head off. Well done. Last step - remove the hide. </>

No matter what you pick, you’ll have to put it in a pan, then mash it into a pulp. Don’t be afraid to put some strength into it, dear. Next, add water and boil it on high heat, then simmer for a bit. Lastly, pour it into a jar (don’t forget to sterilize it first). There. All done!

FIRE
I didn’t have much time. Did my best to stop the bleeding, but the smell was bound to get me in trouble. And it would be dark soon. The only thing I had left was my knife, and I thanked the heavens for it. But it wouldn’t do me any good if those wolves decided I smelled tasty. I saw them the day before, just small, grey shapes against the green of the forest. At the time, I thought nothing of it. Now I prayed they were too far away to get the scent.

My hands shook as I cut the birch bark, as fine as I could make it. I threw it into a small pit, then struck a rock with my knife. Sparks flew but didn’t take. I tried again, and again, growing more desperate each time I watched my sparks die. Then I remembered. Oxygen. I struck again, this time blowing gently on the birch nest. As I watched it ignite, I felt relief wash over me. I wouldn’t die. Not today at least.

FEVER
I found shelter. An old hut, falling apart in places. Nothing much. But still, I felt like I found a chest of pure gold.

Had to walk for a long time. I thought I’d freeze. And when I woke up the next day, my head was as hot as those pieces of coal in the fireplace. Had a hard time thinking, but I needed to do something. So I went to get some turkey tails. And no, I’m not talking about the blasted bird. Those are mushrooms you use to brew tea. Bitter but effective if you want to get rid of a fever. I went into the deep forest and found a bunch growing on dead trees. Came back and made the tea. It should do the trick.

Nov 19, 1981       
EXHAUSTION
The fever went down but it’d drained my strength. My wound was healing slowly. No way I could hunt, and the traps failed to do their job. The few carrots and berries I found wouldn’t keep me alive long enough to heal. I needed to get some meat. Fast.

I had to make some herbal tea. Speed up recovery. Easier said than done... I spent half a day searching, found nothing. But I knew those medicinal herbs were a real treat for rabbits, so I was looking for a colony.  Finally, the next day, I found a big one. The whole glade full of rabbits. And the herbs I needed. Gathered a bunch and made the tea. Set some traps while I was at it.

RABBIT
Finally. One of the traps worked. The one with the biggest, juiciest carrot as bait. I knew those bastards wouldn’t be able to hold back. Opened the trap, and there it was. A nice, plump rabbit. The stew was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten… </>

INFECTED
I messed up. I thought my wound was all better, so I stopped treating it. Didn’t want to waste the alcohol. Today, my leg hurts something fierce. When I unwrapped the bandages…

My wound was infected. If I didn’t act fast, it would kill me. I had to go out again, find a rare kind of herb. I wasn’t even sure if it grew around here. The more I looked, the more hopeless it all seemed. But then, I spotted it! I’d have jumped with joy if not for that blasted leg.

I took the herb home, crushed it in a mortar, then added some alcohol and applied it to the wound. I hope it’ll help. Otherwise…</>

<div>2656_Beaver_Name=Beaver</>
<div>2657_Wolf_Desc=Big, fast and deadly. Its jaws look like they could crush animals twice its size. To make matters worse, they travel in packs, so it’s never just one I have to worry about. They’re smart too. They’ll take turns chasing me and communicate with their packmates. 

Most active at night, so I should avoid traveling after sundown. Their eyes see really well in the dark.

When they’re nearby, my best bet is to hide. If they spot me, I’ll have to run and hope there’s a crack I can squeeze through or a ledge to jump on. Whatever it takes to keep them away from me.

If a wolf attacks me, there’s a good chance it will kill me. I need to find ways to protect myself.

(After player learns to throw rocks to distract wolves:)

If a wolf is nearby, I can throw a rock to distract it. It will follow the rock, and I’ll be able to cross safely. (does it only work with crows now?)

(After player finds a torch:)

It seems wolves are afraid of fire. If they run at me, I’ll have to light a torch and swing it around. This will get rid of them. For a time. 

(After player finds an arm protector:)

I found another way to protect myself - an arm pad. When a wolf jumps at me and bites it, I’ll give the bastard one solid kick. It’ll make it run away whimpering. The downside is it will only work on one wolf.</>

<div>2659_Crow_Name=Crow</>
<div>265_Survival_DryClothes_Tip=Approach and interact with the drying line by pressing <img id="{Interact}"/>. Place your chosen clothes in the slots in the drying line and wait for them to dry. </>
<div>2660_Deer_Name=Deer</>
<div>2661_Rabbit_Desc=Fast and agile. Can run for a really long time. I’ve got no chance to catch it with my bare hands. It’s extremely alert too. So I won’t be able to sneak up on it close enough to grab it.

Where there’s one rabbit, there’ll be more. They seem to live in large groups. They always disappear into their tunnels when I try to chase them.

I could try to hit one with a rock. But I’d have to get near first. A trap would probably be easier.</>
<div>2662_Deer_Desc=Fast, agile and extremely alert. Trying to catch it with my bare hands is pointless. So is using the axe. I won’t even be able to get close. And there’s no way I can outrun it.

If I want to catch it, I’ll need to set a trap. It could give me a lot of resources, like meat, hide and antlers.</>
<div>2663_Fox_Name=Fox</>
<div>2664_Otter_Name=Otter</>
<div>2665_Owl_Name=Owl</>
<div>2666_Rabbit_Name=Rabbit</>
<div>2667_Beaver_Desc=Still active in winter. Lives in the wetlands. It builds domelike lodges out of branches and mud. The only way to get inside is through an underwater entrance.

Beavers don’t leave their lodge during the daytime, so it’s impossible to catch one then. They only come out at night. Setting a trap is my best bet.

Its fur is naturally oily and waterproof. Great material for a new set of clothes.    </>
<div>2668_Fox_Desc=TBD</>
<div>2669_Bear_Desc=The bastard that attacked me and got me separated from Joel. He seems to hold a grudge against me and will chase me every chance he’s got.

Has a ridiculous range of sight and hearing. I have to be careful. When I see him, I should hide and try to get as far away as possible. I don’t think I can outrun him if he spots me.

I have to avoid direct contact and keep my shelter fixed. If I cook outside, I can’t stay in the same spot for long. Just like wolves, he’ll be drawn to the smell.

I don’t see any other bears around. Is he the only one? Did he chase them away? He’s massive and covered with scars. </>
<div>266_Movement_Shimmy_Sub2=Approach the narrow gap to squeeze through</>
<div>2670_Crow_Desc=They’ll circle around an animal carcass. If I follow them, maybe I won’t have to kill my dinner.</>
<div>2671_Owl_Desc=Too fast and alert to catch. But it leaves its nest to hunt at night. I’ve seen a couple of nests in tree holes. I bet I can find some tasty eggs there. </>
<div>2672_Otter_Desc=Very good swimmer. Can be found in the wetlands where beavers live. It takes advantage of their dens and moves in. Usually doesn’t leave till sundown. So I’ll only be able to catch it at night. I need to set a trap.</>
<div>2673_Boar_Desc=Will charge you when angry and destroy stuff you've built. Quite dangerous and front-heavy, attack from sides or rear.</>

<div>2721_67_Writer=I came across a destroyed camp. It belonged to someone who was writing a book about ghost towns. There’s supposed to be one somewhere around here. Where?</>
<div>2722_40_UpgradeJacket=I came across a new path, but it’s too cold to go through. I’ll need warmer clothes.</>
<div>2723_46_FollowTracks=I came across an old railroad switch stand.</>
<div>2724_49_FollowTracks=I came across another old railroad switch stand. It must work the same way as the one I saw earlier in that cave.</>
<div>2725_16_Paratrooper01=I can’t stop thinking about that poor guy… How did he end up here?</>
<div>2726_12b_BuildBigCampfire=I decided to build a huge campfire. Maybe the guys will see it and come find me.</>
<div>2727_01c_PrologueCrow=I discovered that crows will fly away from their spots from time to time, making it easier to locate them. I can throw snowballs or stones to scare them off. They’ll make a loud sound and lure wolves away.</>
<div>2728_20_Hope=I finally talked to Joel. He found Mike!
They’re in a harbor, but Mike’s hurt. Joel can’t leave him.
Joel told me to find train tracks and follow them. I’ll have to reach the guys on my own.</>
<div>2729_31_FollowTracks=I found Joel’s camp.
Joel lost his keychain, the one I made for him. But I picked it up. I’m going to give it back when I find them.</>
<div>272_Survival_CollectFirstAid=Collect the First Aid Kit from the chest</>
<div>2730_38_FindBarracks=I found a letter written by a guy named Kowalski. He seemed pretty pissed his guns were taken. He mentioned going to the barracks (?) to teach people how to make traps.
He also wrote that some “damn kids” stole his trolley key. He left a sketch of their hideout.</>
<div>2731_54a_UnknownLever=I found a lever. I wonder where it belongs.</>

<div>2734_65_ExplorerKid=I found a tree with teeth made of sticks and pebbles for eyes. There was a note buried next to it, together with a toy soldier. Toy soldier is a “reward” and the note is a riddle leading to “the third clue”.</>

<div>2746_04b_Rope=I made the rope. Now’s the time to get the walkie-talkie.</>
<div>2747_41_UpgradeJacket2=I need deer hide to make warmer clothes. I’ve never hunted one before, so I have no idea what I’m doing. Let’s hope the trap will do the job for me. </>

<div>2749_62_RemoveWolf=I opened a trapdoor in Barrack no.3 and went down a ladder. It was so dark…
I… I heard Sarah’s voice. Calling me. Begging like she begged me not to go on that trip. And then, when I got down, she… She told me our baby was dead.
I won’t think about it. I need to keep going. I can’t think about it.
If I think about it, I’ll go crazy…</>

<div>2750_50_InspectStorage=I picked up an old key. Maybe it’ll be useful for something.</>

<div>2752_57_Cave=I reattached the lever and used it to switch tracks. I rode the trolley out of the cave.
The ride felt good. Maybe I could just speed past the dangers and get to Joel?</>
<div>2753_04c_Battery=I retrieved the walkie-talkie, but the battery’s missing.</>
<div>2754_24_ExploreKid=I saw a bizarre-looking place - stacked wood logs with painted faces, arranged in a circle.
Turns out a kid was just playing with his dad. The kid left a note and a map. If I follow it, I’ll get to “the second clue”. Apparently, there's a “great treasure” at the end.</>

<div>2763_07_GetOut=I used the cellar window to get inside the hut. But no one was there. And I couldn’t climb up again.
On the brightside, I found an axe. Used it to destroy the door and left.</>
<div>2764_13_FixShelter=If that bear had come from the other side... I was lucky. I have to be smarter or I won’t live long. I need to fix the shelter. First, patch those holes in the wall.</>

Only one grave. A guy’s named Hank Tyler. It dates back to the 1800s. More than a century ago. All those people are gone now…
I should find that track part and get the hell away from here.</>

I even found a walkie-talkie battery there.</>
<div>2807_08_Bridge=The footprints ended at an old bridge. Didn’t look stable enough to cross, so I turned back.
I also saw a piece of torn cloth. Did Joel or Mike go through? Whoever left those tracks, I’m glad they got away.</>

<div>4709_Loading_14=Different injuries and illnesses require different healing methods. Use a first aid kit, a bandage or alcohol for wounds, and a leg stabilizer for sprains.

<div>4726_Loading_13=Some elements of your gear and parts of the environment have limited durability. Eventually, your axe will break, and your clothes can get damaged by going through thorn bushes or tunnels with sharp edges. But you’ll also be able to break through doors and metal-reinforced doors (requires an improved axe).</>

<div>4731_Loading_03=The world around you might be cold and unforgiving, but it’s also full of resources. There are plenty of harvestable plants, mushrooms, bushes, and dead trees. You can use instinct to detect those elements, but it will cost energy to maintain that focus.</>
<div>4732_DifficultyOptionNofi=This setting can be changed later during playthrough in game settings.</>
<div>4733_DemoTutorial_Tutorial=Tutorial</>
<div>4734_Loading_12=Use the environment to protect yourself from predators. Hiding bushes will allow you to pass unnoticed, and holding your breath will make it even more effective. If an animal is blocking your path, you can distract it by throwing a stone or a snowball (snowballs only work if there are crows nearby to scare away).</>
<div>4735_SurveyLinks=We hope you enjoyed this first look into our game and will follow it on Steam and social media. 
There is lot happening around the game’s development over the next months and following us will keep you up-to-date when it comes to all the cool things we are implementing.

Please feel free to use the links below for the medium you prefer.</>
<div>4736_DemoTutorial_MainText=We prepared an interactive tutorial system for a better understanding of key mechanics. It's recommended both for new and experienced survival players.

Do you want to continue?

<div>4737_SurveyDesc=We would really appreciate you taking part in our small survey. 

It only contains 17 questions, so it won’t take up much of your time, but your feedback will allow us to make the game better and determine areas to focus on more.</>

<div>473_BarkDebuffTwisted_003=Boo!</>
<div>4740_Loading_07=Wolves have excellent night vision, and they’re most active after sundown. They usually travel in packs. If you spot them, use bushes to hide and wait for them to pass. Alternatively, you can distract them with a stone or a snowball. If they notice you, use a torch to scare them away. If you don’t have any, you’ll have to run and hope your stamina lasts long enough to get away.</>
<div>4741_Demo_Welcome_lol=You are dying.</>
<div>4742_Loading_04=You can climb, crawl and squeeze between rocks to reach certain areas or make your traversing faster. When in danger, you can hide in small, enclosed spaces, but your sanity will suffer. In time, you’ll discover a more efficient way to travel, which will also save you a lot of energy.</>
<div>4743_Loading_02=You can fix and improve your clothes for better protection against the elements. You can also find or craft basic survival tools like an axe, traps, and canteen. In time, you’ll find ways to temporarily improve your gear - add extra heat or wetness protection, add an ability to scale icy surfaces, and more.</>
<div>4744_Loading_11=You can learn more about the place you’re in and its history by finding notes and journals left by the previous inhabitants. They’ll contain survival tips, new recipes, and sometimes even hints about what to do next. You might also find more recently-left crates with cigarettes, alcohol and other useful supplies.</>
<div>4745_Demo_EndGame=You have reached the end of the demo version. You can continue the game, but your end is near.</>
<div>4746_Loading_08=You have to keep yourself fed. You can forage food like carrots, potatoes, berries and mushrooms, but it won’t be very filling. You should try to get meat whenever you can, and remember to always cook it. In time, you’ll learn to cook nourishing meals like stews, which will help you survive.</>
<div>4747_Demo_End01=Your journey ends here, </>
<div>4748_Loading_10=Your mental state is affected by everything that’s happening to you. If you neglect your health, hurt yourself or witness a frightening event, it will take a toll on your sanity. At some point, your brain won’t be able to take more trauma. Your sanity will suffer permanently, and the consequences will make your survival much harder.</>
