After accelerated basic training , the squad is armed with the simplest and most massive weapons - civilian semi-automatic variant of the AR15 rifle, which lacks the fully automatic function, has a very low fire rate because of this.

Those troops aren't well trained, but their strength lies in numbers; with time and some effort from the leadership a simple militia squad can grow into a professional team of hard-boiled killers.

<div>02AF8118274F90ABBC2D9F3F65D5A1E3=A towable heavy cannon platform in the basic version with a 120 mm cannon mounted in an armored turret.

The Movement got the foundation for this weapon when it found a few storage bases with old army cannons conserved inside. 

By mounting the cannon on the towable platform, the Movement managed to increase its mobility. However, despite the ability to fire while moving, for increased accuracy shoot only after stopping. For maximum accuracy, detach the platform from the tractor to fix it in place with several supports.

Instead of the base cannon, any heavy cannon can be installed on the platform, including the Heavy howitzer 155mm cannon - the most powerful high-explosive weapon, capable of destroying any fortification at a maximum distance. 

In addition to the main weapon, a heavy machine gun can be mounted on the roof, which can be replaced with another mounted weapon.

The platform can be towed by any vehicle that is suitable for towing of heavy trailers.

It can be towed by any vehicle that is suitable for towing of heavy trailers.</>

The best tactic for this squad is a hit and run one; or, better yet, hit and drive away in whatever's available nearby - it helps that the squad can crew light vehicles.</>

Can tow light and heavy trailers except those requiring a fifth wheel mount.</>

Yes, not every mounted weapon can be installed in such a system (for example, recoilless rifles), but thanks to remote control there is no risk of losing the shooter.

In addition, this weapon system is equipped with smoke grenade launchers, which, when used correctly, significantly increases the survivability of the vehicle and the supported infantry.

Good mobility and protection for its class. But at the same time, it has a large mass and average off-road capability, which is further aggravated if additional armor is installed.

Overall, a good tool for quickly transporting troops to the battlefield and for organizing some light support for troops.</>

It is unknown from where the Integrators were able to get this technology, but the projectiles fired by this gun can penetrate absolutely any armor. Ineffective against infantry, the cannon can destroy even a Legion tank with one shot. &#10;&#10;The prototype, apparently, is still being tested, and for this it was installed on a self-propelled chassis based on an old Sherman tank, which, contrary to the standards of Integrators, was not transferred to electric traction. Apparently the Integrators simply did not have time to redo it until the moment of abduction. Why the old Sherman was chosen as the chassis is unlikely to be answered by anyone other than the Integrators themselves. Integrators are just weird individuals...&#10;&#10;As a result: weak armor, low velocity, the inability to shoot on the move, but colossal killing power.</>

<div>256AF9C9DBDC05F42BF20B5B91C06E6F=The Integrator tank, like their other vehicles is made by mixing various technologies. 

A modified turret from the Movement Heavy platform was installed on the Legion tank chassis. Apparently, there is no way to make room for people in the turret or hull of a standard Legion tank. 

As a result, despite all the efforts of the Integrators, the tank's protection was more at the level of a Movement Heavy platform (with additional armor) than at the level of a Legion tank.

Due to lack of space and different weight distribution of the turret, only one of the two heavy plasma cannons of the Legion tank remained, which affected the rate of fire.

Despite all these shortcomings, the tank is quite a formidable force to be reckoned with on the battlefield!</>

This version is for infantry transporting. Considering that Legion's cyborgs were designed to survive the destruction of carrier vehicles, the platforms became an excellent solution for transporting slow-moving homunculi and, if necessary, transporting them directly into battle.

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>278D201B844BAA9F66FA2300165779B4=Legion Spiders are the main fire support unit for Legion infantry machines; they are light and mobile weapon platforms that can be outfitted with various weapons. 

They can use any light cannons and rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs. 

This Spider model is equipped with a pair of MLRS launchers with Forward Firing Aircraft Rockets, making it an effective weapon against crowded enemy infantry and light armored vehicles. The chassis is too light and, due to recoil, does not allow targeted firing of rockets, but this is not required when you are hitting an area, and not a single target.</>

In addition, the plasma recoilless rifle has a much larger stock of shots than ATGM system, but... noticeably less than the classic recoilless. 

Another noticeable disadvantage is a significant decrease in anti-personnel effectiveness compared to the classic one. Because of this, the weapon is not used automatically against infantry (including infantry inside buildings).

<div>308FBDC77259E2CA5B65ED50F1AA5075=The M2 Bradley IFV is the main workhorse for the Founders. The best tool for transporting and supporting troops on the battlefield.

It is easy to modify and, with enough skill and right upgrade kit, can turn into an infantry support or a tank support vehicle - or anything else, as long as there is the kit to fit on it. 

It seems that the Founders made the most modifications and upgrades for this vehicle.

Among the shortcomings, there is only a small troop compartment and, accordingly, there is little space for both infantry and ammo supply for them.</>

<div>32AB1B6FC1518689A43BC624ACC09CAE=The M1 Abrams is the main tank used by the Founders. 

Its heavy firepower is complemented by its decent speed and fuel capacity. The downside is that it requires a huge amount of fuel to maintain.

It has the best armor among Founders and Movement vehicles, which can be further improved by installing additional armor sets and an active protection system. But like for any tank, it’s better not to expose its sides, and especially its back, to the enemy.

The engine can be boosted and the large turret can be equipped with various types of heavy guns; and different mounted weapons can be installed on the roof.</>

<div>44557296B02E6EA9030F989E91207607=Rev-6 terminators are cutting-edge humanoid models with updated Legion design - biomodelling, artificial muscles, “everlasting” batteries, composite and nanomaterials. They're resilient, mobile and deadly. 

The advanced chassis and software allow Revs to use any trophies from the battlefield: both any infantry weapons and any vehicles, including tanks and helicopters.

An interesting feature of this model is the possibility of parachute-free deployment from HK Aerials, not even having to lower its flight altitude for this.

Another feature of the model is the nano-robots used for the first time by Legion, capable of repairing Rev-6's when they go into complete inactivity (does not move, does not observe enemies).

And in order not to give people any chance, this model can switch to the Charge mode, accompanied by a colossal acceleration and transition to hand-to-hand combat mode, which allows you to literally sweep an area with enemy infantry in a matter of seconds.

Sadly for Legion (and happily for humans), making Rev terminators is a very labor-intensive and protracted process, requiring huge amounts of special materials. This might be the only reason that humanity hasn't yet been eradicated by these machines of death.</>

<div>581A8B657867CD3E04AE4AD1E288A3A0=Rev-6 terminators are cutting-edge humanoid models with updated Legion design - biomodelling, artificial muscles, “everlasting” batteries, composite and nanomaterials. They're resilient, mobile and deadly. &#10;&#10;The advanced chassis and software allow Revs to use any trophies from the battlefield: both any infantry weapons and any vehicles, including tanks and helicopters.&#10;&#10;An interesting feature of this model is the possibility of parachute-free deployment from HK Aerials, not even having to lower its flight altitude for this.&#10;&#10;Another feature of the model is the nano-robots used for the first time by Legion, capable of repairing Rev-6's when they go into complete inactivity (does not move, does not observe enemies).&#10;&#10;And in order not to give people any chance, this model can switch to the Charge mode, accompanied by a colossal acceleration and transition to hand-to-hand combat mode, which allows you to literally sweep an area with enemy infantry in a matter of seconds.&#10;&#10;Sadly for Legion (and happily for humans), making Rev terminators is a very labor-intensive and protracted process, requiring huge amounts of special materials. This might be the only reason that humanity hasn't yet been eradicated by these machines of death.</>

<div>582799F5E7EC2688F307E1240FB6DDFD=There is never enough firepower in full-scale battles. To solve this problem, Legion designed a new type of platform with heavy weapons.

The chassis of the transport platform was used as the basis. Unification sped up production and quickly made it possible to provide strike groups with new units.

This version is equipped with a heavy plasma cannon. Tank power on a fast platform. But it must be taken into account that the armor remains the same and there is a high risk of quickly losing the platform, sending it to a breakthrough in the front row.

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>62148CAAD7D767E8595C4E553D746350=This armored vehicle was developed for use in the overseas departments of France to conduct military-police and counter-guerrilla activities, escort convoys and motorized convoys in areas of guerrilla activity. 

A large number of these machines were delivered to the armed forces of Latin American countries. From these stocks, a large amount of the surviving vehicles migrated to the Cartel detachments where it is used for approximately the same purposes for which France originally created it. 

Despite the fact that this is a very outdated and lightly armored vehicle (the armor on the sides does not even reach the level of the Stryker), it copes perfectly with its functions of suppressing uprisings of the local population.</>

The chassis of the transport platform was used as the basis. Unification sped up production and quickly made it possible to provide strike groups with new units.

This version is equipped with a twin light plasma cannon. Much less rate and density of fire than the heavy rotary 30mm cannon, but more damage and penetration (unless the target is equipped with reactive, cage or ceramic armor).

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

However, once humans had established stronghold HQs, fortified areas with multiple layers of defenses and other positional warfare measures, it became obvious that light terminators wouldn't be enough. &#10;&#10;The Legion tank is the pinnacle of Legion heavy vehicle technology. Its main uses are the same as all other tanks' - punching through the enemy's established fortifications and providing supporting fire for advancing infantry during large-scale engagements. The tank is imposing, powerful and protected, but, due to its mass and size, somewhat slow.&#10;&#10;The presence of a large under armor space allowed Legion to place a pack of repair drones which able to quickly repair any functional damage right on the battlefield.  Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

To solve this problem, Legion designed a new type of platform with heavy weapons.&#10;&#10;The chassis of the transport platform was used as the basis. Unification sped up production and quickly made it possible to provide strike groups with new units.&#10;&#10;This version is equipped with a heavy plasma cannon. Tank power on a fast platform. But it must be taken into account that the armor remains the same and there is a high risk of quickly losing the platform, sending it to a breakthrough in the front row.&#10;&#10;As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

The next step in the development of Legion's transport platform was the addition of a turret with various light cannons. This greatly increased the firepower of the platform and its value on the battlefield, not only as a means of delivering infantry to the front line, but also as a means of supporting troops.

This version is equipped with a light plasma cannon.

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

Like any other trailer, it can be detached from the tractor to be used as a stationary firing position. In this state, the accuracy of the cannon increases.

Can only be towed by vehicles with a fifth wheel mount such as Movement Dozer and Main tractor.</>

Very weak building - up to 30% splash, up to 35% miss chance.

They can use any light cannons and rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs. 

This Spider model is equipped with a pair of anti-tank guided missile launchers, making it Legion's primary light anti-tank unit.</>

To make HIMARS fire at your enemies you need to select it and then click "Attack with all weapons!" order button, then click LMB on the ground spot you want to annihilate. 

Please note that HIMARS has very big maximum range of fire but it also has big minimum range of fire. HIMARS can't fire within minimum radius. 

Choose your unit's targets carefully, because recharging costs are very high.

<div>A9F495AF26378CB089592BCCA025FB5F=The unique newest product of Integrators. 

The key to this tank is a brand new, super powerful Gaussian cannon. It is unknown from where the Integrators were able to get this technology, but the projectiles fired by this gun can penetrate absolutely any armor. Ineffective against infantry, the cannon can destroy even a Legion tank with one shot. 

The prototype, apparently, is still being tested, and for this it was installed on a self-propelled chassis based on an old Sherman tank, which, contrary to the standards of Integrators, was not transferred to electric traction. Apparently the Integrators simply did not have time to redo it until the moment of abduction. Why the old Sherman was chosen as the chassis is unlikely to be answered by anyone other than the Integrators themselves. Integrators are just weird individuals...

As a result: weak armor, low velocity, the inability to shoot on the move, but colossal killing power.</>

Apparently, there is no way to make room for people in the turret or hull of a standard Legion tank. &#10;&#10;As a result, despite all the efforts of the Integrators, the tank's protection was more at the level of a Movement Heavy platform (with additional armor) than at the level of a Legion tank.&#10;&#10;Due to lack of space and different weight distribution of the turret, only one of the two heavy plasma cannons of the Legion tank remained, which affected the rate of fire.&#10;&#10;Despite all these shortcomings, the tank is quite a formidable force to be reckoned with on the battlefield!</>

<div>AEB5704CED3DAFD0C847FB866ECAD5F0=The Homunculi are cheap humanoid cyborgs based on an outdated model from before Legions Uprising.
 
Legion continues to produce these terminators thanks to their low cost and the ability to mass-produce them at old assembly lines captured from the humans. 

The Homunculi might not be very resilient or as capable as modern Rev models, but they manage the minimum fairly well - they can operate various infantry weapons, including trophies picked up on the battlefield. Even a single squad can be a big problem for a small human settlement, and, considering their potential quantity, they can be a force to be reckoned with.

Their extremely low speed of movement prompted Legion to develop the Carrier Platform, which then resulted in the production of a whole series of different platforms based on it.</>

Originally developed by the US military, Legion captured the schematics and took over control during its uprising. 

A Swarm's main use is reconnaissance however these are fitted with explosive self destruct capabilities that can damage enemy units, mostly infantry and light vehicles. High camouflage allows drones to wait “for hours” for their prey and attack it without a separate order (while in "Offensive mode" AI). 

In addition, with some luck and proper preparation to distract the enemy’s attention, such a swarm can effectively clear a building occupied by the enemy (in the mode of executing an Assault order).</>

<div>B5333C709C0FE8CF4586475F7DD47BA3=Legion Spiders are the main fire support unit for Legion infantry machines; they are light and mobile weapon platforms that can be outfitted with various weapons. 

They can use any light cannons and rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs.

The most basic model without rocket launchers turned out to be the most popular due to low manufacturing costs. Often the fire from cannons of this model is enough to provide adequate support.</>

However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs. &#10;&#10;This Spider model is equipped with a pair of anti-tank guided missile launchers, making it Legion's primary light anti-tank unit.</>

<div>BAE5B8F7A329930A8379EFDBADD566EE=There is never enough firepower in full-scale battles. To solve this problem, Legion designed a new type of platform with heavy weapons.

The chassis of the transport platform was used as the basis. Unification sped up production and quickly made it possible to provide strike groups with new units.

This version is equipped with a heavy rotary 30mm cannon. The loss of shot power compared to the base heavy plasma cannon is compensated by a significantly increased fire density. This weapon turns the platform into a mobile grinder capable of grinding both infantry and not heavily armored vehicles.  

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>C313EEFE9C565C37A0BC21FD64A095DB=Much less deadly than 155mm howitzer cannon but it has higher firerate. Also has less range than its "big brother". After movement, to start shooting the platform also must be fixed in place with several supports, which somewhat slows down the preparation for the first shot. 

An important feature is that after installation, doesn't transfer the unit to the artillery class, which allows you to get light howitzer at almost any moment of the mission during reinforcement calls.

It is a tracked armored personnel carrier with a wide range of mounted weapons. In the basic version it is not very protected, but compensates for this with decent mobility and off-road maneuverability.

Even a single squad can be a big problem for a small human settlement, and, considering their potential quantity, they can be a force to be reckoned with.&#10;&#10;Their extremely low speed of movement prompted Legion to develop the Carrier Platform, which then resulted in the production of a whole series of different platforms based on it.</>

<div>D6B60EB1CE73FDC227BF58F194102182=There is never enough firepower in full-scale battles. To solve this problem, Legion designed a new type of platform with heavy weapons.&#10;&#10;The chassis of the transport platform was used as the basis. Unification sped up production and quickly made it possible to provide strike groups with new units.&#10;&#10;This version is equipped with a heavy rotary 30mm cannon. The loss of shot power compared to the base heavy plasma cannon is compensated by a significantly increased fire density. This weapon turns the platform into a mobile grinder capable of grinding both infantry and not heavily armored vehicles.  &#10;&#10;As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>D741906F149A0F2A5EAD692076023D3F=A Wolf Pack is a squad of cyberwolves. 

They are Legion's attempt to increase its forces' overall mobility and scale by using swift, lightweight four-legged platforms with small arms mounted on them. 

These squads are perfect for reconnaissance and patrolling; in addition, during large-scale engagements they can quickly close the distance to hostile forces, unnerving them and drawing fire away from more important targets. Perfect for hit-and-run attacks on isolated targets that don't have enough support.

But even Legion was unable to teach these machines to use stairs, so they have a software restriction on entering buildings.</>

The platform is balanced in a way that allows it to fire while moving (except for the howitzer version), though at the cost of some accuracy.

If you need maximum accuracy, the platform needs to be detached from the tractor and fixed in place with several supports. 

It can be towed by any vehicle that is suitable for towing.</>

<div>DCABD662905E608E0B0E3BC4058F444F=Standardized transport platforms are used by Legion for all manners of tasks.

The next step in the development of Legion's transport platform was the addition of a turret with various light cannons. This greatly increased the firepower of the platform and its value on the battlefield, not only as a means of delivering infantry to the front line, but also as a means of supporting troops.

This version is equipped with a standard 25mm automatic cannon similar to those used on the base Bradley model.

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>E0A42CE9259231AF9CADA688C5A3D910=The main Legion tanks are tracked platforms bearing heavy plasma cannons. 

It took some time for Legion to start building these - it prefers biology-inspired designs in its terminators. However, once humans had established stronghold HQs, fortified areas with multiple layers of defenses and other positional warfare measures, it became obvious that light terminators wouldn't be enough. 

The Legion tank is the pinnacle of Legion heavy vehicle technology. Its main uses are the same as all other tanks' - punching through the enemy's established fortifications and providing supporting fire for advancing infantry during large-scale engagements. The tank is imposing, powerful and protected, but, due to its mass and size, somewhat slow.

The presence of a large under armor space allowed Legion to place a pack of repair drones which able to quickly repair any functional damage right on the battlefield.  Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>E35F20DB552750E99C83FE8F9F084563=Legion Spiders are the main fire support unit for Legion infantry machines; they are light and mobile weapon platforms that can be outfitted with various weapons. &#10;&#10;They can use any light cannons and&#160;rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs.&#10;&#10;Even after Judgment Day, humanity still had a small amount of military aircraft left. And some have even adapted to using light civil aviation aircraft as carriers of bombs and unguided missiles. This Spider model carries a pair of surface-to-air missiles launchers, making it indispensable for air defense.</>

High camouflage allows drones to wait “for hours” for their prey and attack it without a separate order (while in &quot;Offensive mode&quot; AI). &#10;&#10;In addition, with some luck and proper preparation to distract the enemy’s attention, such a swarm can effectively clear a building occupied by the enemy (in the mode of executing an Assault order).</>

The next step in the development of Legion's transport platform was the addition of a turret with various light cannons. This greatly increased the firepower of the platform and its value on the battlefield, not only as a means of delivering infantry to the front line, but also as a means of supporting troops.

This version is equipped with a light rotary 20mm cannon.

As in Legion Tank, the Platforms contains repair drones capable of quickly fixing any functional damage right on the battlefield. Drones are very vulnerable. Having lost the drones, the unit will lose the possibility of repair.</>

<div>EBD16597D918C986368BB7EA11603C56=Legion Spiders are the main fire support unit for Legion infantry machines; they are light and mobile weapon platforms that can be outfitted with various weapons. 

They can use any light cannons and rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs.

Even after Judgment Day, humanity still had a small amount of military aircraft left. And some have even adapted to using light civil aviation aircraft as carriers of bombs and unguided missiles. This Spider model carries a pair of surface-to-air missiles launchers, making it indispensable for air defense.</>

<div>F471B37C793D034F2F88EA1CF5F54982=Legion Spiders are the main fire support unit for Legion infantry machines; they are light and mobile weapon platforms that can be outfitted with various weapons. &#10;&#10;They can use any light cannons and&#160;rocket launchers, including guided missile launchers. However, due to their low mass, Spiders have a small drawback - the chassis can't be outfitted with different weapons in the left and right limbs, balancing requires all weapons to be installed in pairs.&#10;&#10;The most basic model without rocket launchers turned out to be the most popular due to low manufacturing costs. Often the fire from cannons of this model is enough to provide adequate support.</>

Can be quickly deployed into a resupply station for troops and vehicles. 

In addition to the cargo body it has a booth for maintenance personnel, on the roof of which a heavy machine gun can be installed (with the possibility of being replaced with any mounted weapon). 

A fighter behind a machine gun significantly increases the vision and survivability of a trailer left without cover.

Can only be towed by vehicles with a fifth wheel mount such as Movement Dozer and Main tractor.</>

Perfect for hit-and-run attacks on isolated targets that don't have enough support.&#10;&#10;But even Legion was unable to teach these machines to use stairs, so they have a software restriction on entering buildings.</>
