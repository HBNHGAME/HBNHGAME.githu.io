WOLF 1
First time I saw him, he was tearing into his packmate’s belly. His massive jaw clamping around flesh, his fangs ripping out the insides. No mercy. No remorse. The other wolf let out a long, piercing cry, then went completely still. I don’t know what its crime was, and at that moment, I felt sorry for it. But even more so, I couldn’t take my eyes away from its killer. He was magnificent, twice as big as any other wolf I’ve ever seen, with a thick, shiny pelt. He glanced around the cave as if making sure his pack got the message, then yawned and curled up, ready to sleep. Everyone else soon followed.

This was my only chance. I came here hoping to dig out some meat, but the wolves got back too soon. Caught me off guard. I knew I didn’t have much time. Wolves don’t really sleep as much as they power nap. Honestly, I didn’t think I was going to make it. Not after seeing what their leader did.</>

WOLF 2
I saw him again. I was lying in bed, and when I opened my eyes, there he was. His claws digging into my chest, his teeth bared in a soundless snarl. I could only stare at him, my body frozen in horror. And then, his massive jaws opened, and darkness swallowed me. I woke up to the sound of my own screams.

I thought that was the end of it. But ever since then, something’s… changed. I see things in the forest. Shapes from the corner of my eye. But they’re gone as soon as I look their way. Am I just tired?

I think one of them looked like a wolf…</>

DEER TRAP
As I was building the trap, my mind went back to the Wolf. The way he massacred his packmate, then went right back to sleep. I started wondering what it would feel like to be such a creature. To rush through the land, driven by hunger and instinct, but still smart enough to herd your prey into ravines. Deep snowbanks. Slow it down. Take turns to tire it out. Let the young ones watch and learn. And then, finally. Sink your teeth into it. Gorge on 20 pounds of meat.

The trap was ready. All I had to do was find deer tracks and set it somewhere along the trail. Then wait till I heard the sound. The sound of something struggling to survive, but in a way, already dead. The trap was efficient. But it felt… clumsy. Compared to the way wolves hunt, it felt like cheating.

Surviving in the wild - how to skin a deer
Practice makes perfect. Start with the legs. You should cut around all four of them, then along the interior. That will loosen the skin. Next, pull the hide off the hind legs. Slice through the connective tissue to separate the skin from thigh muscles and bones. After that, it’s easy. Just grab the hide and peel it down, away from the torso. Stop at the shoulders. You’ll need to slice through the connective tissue again, then through the front legs, the same way you did with the rear ones. Then, skin the neck and chop the head off. Well done. Last step - remove the hide. </>

To make jam, you just need some fruit and water. What you can find around here are blueberries, blackberries and cranberries. And oh my, how delicious they all taste! And don’t worry if you don’t have any sugar, dear. I know it’s hard to come by. Your jam will be yummy without it, I promise!

No matter what you pick, you’ll have to put it in a pan, then mash it into a pulp. Don’t be afraid to put some strength into it, dear. Next, add water and boil it on high heat, then simmer for a bit. Lastly, pour it into a jar (don’t forget to sterilize it first). There. All done!

FIRE
I didn’t have much time. Did my best to stop the bleeding, but the smell was bound to get me in trouble. And it would be dark soon. The only thing I had left was my knife, and I thanked the heavens for it. But it wouldn’t do me any good if those wolves decided I smelled tasty. I saw them the day before, just small, grey shapes against the green of the forest. At the time, I thought nothing of it. Now I prayed they were too far away to get the scent.

My hands shook as I cut the birch bark, as fine as I could make it. I threw it into a small pit, then struck a rock with my knife. Sparks flew but didn’t take. I tried again, and again, growing more desperate each time I watched my sparks die. Then I remembered. Oxygen. I struck again, this time blowing gently on the birch nest. As I watched it ignite, I felt relief wash over me. I wouldn’t die. Not today at least. 

Nov 17, 1981
FEVER
I found shelter. An old hut, falling apart in places. Nothing much. But still, I felt like I found a chest of pure gold.

Had to walk for a long time. I thought I’d freeze. And when I woke up the next day, my head was as hot as those pieces of coal in the fireplace. Had a hard time thinking, but I needed to do something. So I went to get some turkey tails. And no, I’m not talking about the blasted bird. Those are mushrooms you use to brew tea. Bitter but effective if you want to get rid of a fever. I went into the deep forest and found a bunch growing on dead trees. Came back and made the tea. It should do the trick.

Nov 19, 1981       
EXHAUSTION
The fever went down but it’d drained my strength. My wound was healing slowly. No way I could hunt, and the traps failed to do their job. The few carrots and berries I found wouldn’t keep me alive long enough to heal. I needed to get some meat. Fast.

I had to make some herbal tea. Speed up recovery. Easier said than done... I spent half a day searching, found nothing. But I knew those medicinal herbs were a real treat for rabbits, so I was looking for a colony.  Finally, the next day, I found a big one. The whole glade full of rabbits. And the herbs I needed. Gathered a bunch and made the tea. Set some traps while I was at it.

RABBIT
Finally. One of the traps worked. The one with the biggest, juiciest carrot as bait. I knew those bastards wouldn’t be able to hold back. Opened the trap, and there it was. A nice, plump rabbit. The stew was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten… </>

INFECTED
I messed up. I thought my wound was all better, so I stopped treating it. Didn’t want to waste the alcohol. Today, my leg hurts something fierce. When I unwrapped the bandages…

My wound was infected. If I didn’t act fast, it would kill me. I had to go out again, find a rare kind of herb. I wasn’t even sure if it grew around here. The more I looked, the more hopeless it all seemed. But then, I spotted it! I’d have jumped with joy if not for that blasted leg.

I took the herb home, crushed it in a mortar, then added some alcohol and applied it to the wound. I hope it’ll help. Otherwise…</>

<div id='2657_Wolf_Desc.en.txt'>Big, fast and deadly. Its jaws look like they could crush animals twice its size. To make matters worse, they travel in packs, so it’s never just one I have to worry about. They’re smart too. They’ll take turns chasing me and communicate with their packmates. 

Most active at night, so I should avoid traveling after sundown. Their eyes see really well in the dark.

When they’re nearby, my best bet is to hide. If they spot me, I’ll have to run and hope there’s a crack I can squeeze through or a ledge to jump on. Whatever it takes to keep them away from me.

If a wolf attacks me, there’s a good chance it will kill me. I need to find ways to protect myself.

(After player learns to throw rocks to distract wolves:)

If a wolf is nearby, I can throw a rock to distract it. It will follow the rock, and I’ll be able to cross safely. (does it only work with crows now?)

(After player finds a torch:)

It seems wolves are afraid of fire. If they run at me, I’ll have to light a torch and swing it around. This will get rid of them. For a time. 

(After player finds an arm protector:)

I found another way to protect myself - an arm pad. When a wolf jumps at me and bites it, I’ll give the bastard one solid kick. It’ll make it run away whimpering. The downside is it will only work on one wolf.</>

<div id='2661_Rabbit_Desc.en.txt'>Fast and agile. Can run for a really long time. I’ve got no chance to catch it with my bare hands. It’s extremely alert too. So I won’t be able to sneak up on it close enough to grab it.

Where there’s one rabbit, there’ll be more. They seem to live in large groups. They always disappear into their tunnels when I try to chase them.

I could try to hit one with a rock. But I’d have to get near first. A trap would probably be easier.</>
<div id='2662_Deer_Desc.en.txt'>Fast, agile and extremely alert. Trying to catch it with my bare hands is pointless. So is using the axe. I won’t even be able to get close. And there’s no way I can outrun it.

If I want to catch it, I’ll need to set a trap. It could give me a lot of resources, like meat, hide and antlers.</>

Beavers don’t leave their lodge during the daytime, so it’s impossible to catch one then. They only come out at night. Setting a trap is my best bet.

Its fur is naturally oily and waterproof. Great material for a new set of clothes.    </>

<div id='2669_Bear_Desc.en.txt'>The bastard that attacked me and got me separated from Joel. He seems to hold a grudge against me and will chase me every chance he’s got.

Has a ridiculous range of sight and hearing. I have to be careful. When I see him, I should hide and try to get as far away as possible. I don’t think I can outrun him if he spots me.

I have to avoid direct contact and keep my shelter fixed. If I cook outside, I can’t stay in the same spot for long. Just like wolves, he’ll be drawn to the smell.

I don’t see any other bears around. Is he the only one? Did he chase them away? He’s massive and covered with scars. </>
